* Building
So this is just done with [[https://leiningen.org/][leiningen]], because we <3 leiningen.
Build by running ~lein uberjar~, which will write a jar to ~target/uberjar~.

* Running
The uberjar created above can be run with either ~lein run~, or ~java -jar target/uberjar/[jar-name]~.
If this is being run in prod, it should be run with ~lein trampoline run~ to save memory.
